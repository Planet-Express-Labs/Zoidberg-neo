        Would you like to enable image filtering? We use state of the art AI models to detect NSFW images.

        Commonly found NSFW images are stored in a database to reduce load.
        We do not store copies of images that are detected, only a hash that can't be turned back into an image.

        AI Filtering uses advanced AI to detect NSFW images. This includes images containing gore and may falsely 
        detect images of medical procedures. At the moment, this cannot be disabled. This feature will send a copy of 
        any new image, in enabled channels, to our image processing partners. 

        Hash filtering uses our database to detect common images that may not be detected by AI.
        These images usually don't contain nudity, but are still extremely suggestive

        You can configure which channels will use this filter on the next page.
